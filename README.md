# Toxicology Project
`* Currently ongoing project`

## What is the Toxicology Project Repository?
The Toxicology Project repository is an ongoing project where I write python scripts that automate data collection from reputable sources for toxicology data such as `https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/`. I also wrangle raw data using R and convert them into a tidy format that will be used for data analysis with my supervisor at the WildLife and Conservation Economics Laboratory at UBC.
